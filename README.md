# Udacity - Rube Goldberg Project

Name: Chun Hiu Ng
How long the project took: 16 Days
System I used to test and develop my project: Vive/WMR
What I liked: I liked creating the trampoline because I made the "bounce" script without any help.
What was challenging: The most challenging was making the Object Menu because I needed to understand fully how the Object Menu works in order to create a fully-working menu that spawns grabbable objects.

This project took me a long time as there were many bugs about the version of Unity/Steam VR SDK and in the actual gameplay. Nonetheless, I have finished this at last.
